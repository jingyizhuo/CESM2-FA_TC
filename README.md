# TC downscaling based on CHAZ
This is a notebook for running The Columbia TC hazard model CHAZ - a statistical-dynamical downscaling model which uses large-scale conditions representing the atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic environment from a global model to predict the genesis, tracks and intensities of synthetic TCs. (Lee et al. 2018, JAMES)

## Three elements of the CHAZ model
### Genesis
### Track
### Intensity
