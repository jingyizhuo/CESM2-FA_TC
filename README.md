# Tropical Cyclone (TC) Downscaling Instructions

### 🌀 How to study TC in the biased CESM2 and less-biased CESM2-FA?

Understanding TC activity and associated risks in both the present and future climate provides valuable information for stakeholders to inform local policy and preparedness measures. Here, we employ a hierarchical modeling approach to assess how mean-state and forced-trend biases in CESM2 influence TCs. 

The hierarchical modeling approach integrates climate simulations from the fully coupled but coarse resolution (~2°atm ~1°ocn) CESM2 and its flux-adjusted counterpart CESM2-FA, along with both statistical-dynamical TC downscaling models and high-resolution atmospheric models (~0.5° and ~0.25°; dynamical TC downscaling).
