### 🛠 Code Acknowledgment
The core components of the TCGI computation code in this repository are adapted from original scripts developed by [Yi Xia](mailto:yx2820@columbia.edu), a PhD student at Columbia University. Please contact her directly for access to the full scripts and ensure proper attribution.

### 📂 My Scripts
Scripts used to compute TCGI for multiple ensemble members of CESM2 and CESM2-FA are available at:

- `/data0/jzhuo/tc_risk/CESM2/code_TCGI/main.sh`
- `/data0/jzhuo/tc_risk/CESM2/code_TCGI/main_fa.sh`

These scripts call `get_TCGI_predictor.py` to get the predictors of TCGI (vws; vmax, which is mpi in terms of wind speed; avort; crh; sd), and then call `cal_TCGI.py` calculate the TCGI of both CRH (Tippett et al. 2011 JCL) and SD (Camargo et al. 2014 JCL) versions.

An example notebook for calculating TCGI—whether using ERA5, other reanalysis products, or climate model outputs—is available at: `/data0/jzhuo/tc_risk/code_TCGI/example_code/code/TCGI.ipynb`

### Note:
TCGI is a weighted sum of several TC-related environmental variables, with weights derived from ERA5.
If you are applying these weights to datasets other than ERA5, bias correction is required. For example:

```python
clim = data_era5 # the 1981-2020 climatology of a predictor based on ERA5 
data = data_yours # your data that need bias correction
data_bc = data + (clim - data.groupby('time.month'))
```
The ERA5 climatology data are saved at: ```/data0/jzhuo/tc_risk/CESM2/data_TCGI/clim_ERA5```
